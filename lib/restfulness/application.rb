module Restfulness

  # 
  # The Restulness::Application is the starting point. It'll deal with 
  # defining the initial configuration, and handle incoming requests
  # from rack. 
  #
  # Build your own Restfulness applications by inheriting from this class:
  #
  #   class MyApp < Restfulness::Application
  #
  #     routes do
  #       scope 'api' do # scope not supported yet!
  #         add 'journey', JourneyResource
  #         add 'journeys', JourneyCollectionResource
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #   end
  #
  class Application

    def router
      self.class.router
    end

    # Rack Handling.
    # Forward rack call to dispatcher
    def call(env)
      @app ||= build_rack_app
      @app.call(env)
    end

          use middleware

      end

      # before handling the request in Restfulness.

      # as used by Rails to reload on each request. e.g.

      #
